# How to run these programs
## Get data from API then save it as CSV
Run ```python step1_getcsv.py```  
The script retrieves data from football-data.org and saves the raw data as a CSV file named ```premier_league_stats.csv``` in the root directory.

## CSV file
"premier_league_stats.csv", on root folder. 

## Clean the data and save the summaries as graphs
Run ```python step2_summarize.py```  
The script read data from CSV file, validate years, Clean the data by handling missing values using median imputation, then sort dataframe and save data as graphs in the fold ```/premier_league_plots/```.

As a result of the data summary, six graphs have been generated with the following names:
* "premier_league_plots\won_by_team_and_year.png",
* "premier_league_plots\draw_by_team_and_year.png",
* "premier_league_plots\lost_by_team_and_year.png",
* "premier_league_plots\goalsFor_by_team_and_year.png",
* "premier_league_plots\goalsAgainst_by_team_and_year.png".

## Test 
I use pytest.    
There are two test files named ```tests\test_step1_getcsv.py``` and ```tests\test_step2_summarize.py```.    
You can run ``` python -m pytest tests\test_step1_getcsv.py```.     
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea858a4e-2b38-4ebe-aa26-0c02bd3c99f8)    
You can run ```python -m pytest tests\test_step2_summarize.py```.

# ★ Root folder, Serverless+AWS
Run command ```serverless deploy```` on Podman env. Notice, not docker env, please use Podman env.    
## Auto Deploy as MicroServices on AWS
We can deploy these programs as microservices on AWS. I created 3 APIs on AWS using Lambda and docker ECR.   
* If you want to refresh data from football-data.org, we can call the API namned ```https://y4zeduzvn3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/get_csv``` with Postman. This API can be invoked to retrieve and refresh the incremental data.   
* If you want to query data from the CSV file (stored on AWS S3), you can use the API ```https://y4zeduzvn3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/query_kpi_from_csv```with Postman. This API can be invoked to return JSON data for your custom query.

These measures make it easier for BI teams to use this processed data and perform personalized queries.

## Program limitation
This token may be a token for the free package, so only data for the past two years can be obtained, and the requested data for 2020-2022 cannot be obtained.   
If we have a token of higher-level packagem, we will access to the requested data for 2020 to 2023.
